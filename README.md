# Portfolio

## Objective

> This is an in-progress portfolio. I built this project primarily to practice media queries and flexbox. The portfolio requires time and attention to be more visually engaging. As I grow as a developer I will add more sophisticated styling and include additional deployed projects for which now there are only placeholders.

## Built with:

* HTML
* CSS

## Website:

[Visit the site on Github Pages.](https://jonprice0.github.io/portfolio/)
